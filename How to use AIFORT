   Execute the main script. You will be prompted to choose between the following options:
        Analyze Network Traffic (PCAP)
        Extract Metadata from File
        Detect AI-Generated Synthetic Media
        Generate PDF Report
        Exit

    Analyze Network Traffic
    Upload a PCAP file for network traffic analysis. The tool will detect anomalies based on packet sizes and identify suspicious IP addresses.

    Extract Metadata
    Provide the path to any file (e.g., image, document) to extract metadata.

    Detect Synthetic Media
    Provide an image file path. The tool will predict if the image is synthetic (AI-generated) or genuine using a trained TensorFlow model.

    Generate a PDF Report
    After performing analysis, generate a detailed PDF report summarizing the results.
